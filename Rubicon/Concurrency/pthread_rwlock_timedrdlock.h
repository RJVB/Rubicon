/**************************************************************************************************//**
 * Mac OS X implementation of the POSIX sem_timedwait() function that is not included in Apple's
 * implementation.
 *
 * sem_timedwait() is the same as sem_wait(), except that abs_timeout specifies a
 * limit on the amount of time that the call should block if the decrement cannot be immediately
 * performed. The abs_timeout argument points to a structure that specifies an absolute timeout in
 * seconds and nanoseconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
 *
 * If the timeout has already expired by the time of the call, and the semaphore could not be
 * locked immediately, then sem_timedwait() fails with a timeout error (errno set to ETIMEDOUT).
 *
 * If the operation can be performed immediately, then sem_timedwait() never fails with a timeout
 * error, regardless of the value of abs_timeout. Furthermore, the validity of abs_timeout is not
 * checked in this case.
 *
 * @param sem the pointer to the semaphore handle.
 * @param abstime points to a structure that specifies an absolute timeout in seconds and
 *                    nanoseconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
 * @return 0 on success; on timeout, the value of the semaphore is left unchanged, -1 is returned,
 *         and errno will have the value ETIMEDOUT; on error, the value of the semaphore is left
 *         unchanged, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.
