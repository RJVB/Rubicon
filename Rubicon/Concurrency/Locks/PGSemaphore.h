	 * Mimics the POSIX sem_timedwait(2p) function.
	 *
	 * This method shall lock the semaphore referenced by this object as in the wait method. However, if
	 * the semaphore cannot be locked without waiting for another process or thread to unlock the semaphore
	 * by calling the post method, this wait shall be terminated when the specified timeout expires.
	 *
     * The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by abstime passes, as measured by the
     * clock on which timeouts are based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds abstime),
     * or if the absolute time specified by abstime has already been passed at the time of the call.
	 *
     * The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The resolution of the timeout shall be the
     * resolution of the clock on which it is based. The timespec data type is defined as a structure in
     * the <time.h> header.
	 *
     * Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout if the semaphore can be locked
     * immediately. The validity of the abstime need not be checked if the semaphore can be locked
     * immediately.
     *
     * For more details see: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_timedwait.3p.html
	 *
	 * @param abstime The absolute time, based on the wall clock, that this method will timeout waiting.
	 * @return YES if it was able to successfully lock the semaphore before the timeout occurred.
	 * @see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_timedwait.3p.html
