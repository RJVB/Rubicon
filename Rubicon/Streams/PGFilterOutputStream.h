 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     While the class NSData provides base64 encoding operations, these class require that the entire data set be held in memory before the encoding begins.  This class, which
 *     inherits from NSOutputStream, allows for the streaming of data to a file and have it encoded "on the fly" without having to retain the entire data set in memory.
