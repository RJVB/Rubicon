 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     While the class NSData provides base64 encoding operations, these class
 *     require that the entire data set be held in memory before the encoding
 *     begins.  This class, which inherits from NSOutputStream, allows for the
 *     streaming of data to a file and have it encoded "on the fly" without
 *     having to retain the entire data set in memory.
