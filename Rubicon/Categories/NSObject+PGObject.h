/**
 * The purpose of this function is to attempt to find a class that is the first common superclass of the two
 * provided classes.  If not common superclass can be found then Nil is returned.  Usually, all classes in
 * normal Objective-C programs share at least one superclass, the root class NSObject.  However, this
 * function makes the assumption that one or both of the provided classes may not ultimately inherit from
 * NSObject.  As such this function uses the Objective-C runtime function class_getSuperclass(Class) rather
 * than assuming that the NSObject class method superclass is available to use.
 *
 * @param c1 the first class.
 * @param c2 the second class.
 * @return the first common superclass or Nil if there isn't one.
